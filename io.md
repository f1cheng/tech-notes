# db  
```  
The five critical differences between SQL and NoSQL are:

SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational.
SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
